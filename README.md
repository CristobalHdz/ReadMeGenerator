# Section 02: General Information
Create an application that when runned, `npm init` => `npm install inquirer` => `node index.js`, it should ask for the project's information, as well as the project's creator info; so it can dinamicaly create a complete README.md file.

# Section 03: My experience
The first section, the questions creation, was easy. I just had to make a quick search for how to ask if they want to add certain sections, as well as for the email format.

The herdest section was all the `init()` and `promises`. Had to do a full search for how to apply it to my project. Also had to ask some friends with how to do it efficiently.

Once inside the `generateMarkdown` was an easy section. It was just get the formating on the README and that is all.
